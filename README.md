# Bigfoot - Case Study

The goal of this case study was to work with messy data. Specifically, we performed data wrangling and EDA on web scraped data from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization. We then extracted latent topics using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) that resembled sighting classifications found during our literature review. The case study culminated with a verbal presentation that summarized our findings and future work.
